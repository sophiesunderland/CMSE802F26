# Scientific Software Starter Template

Starter repository for research teams and students who are new to software engineering.

This template helps you create a research-code repository that is:

- Safe: simple checks catch common mistakes early.
- Portable: uses a shared Conda environment where practical.
- Reproducible: records dependencies and repeatable commands.
- Robust: tests first, then optional quality tools as you grow.
- Literate: optional API docs and notebooks for explainable workflows.
- Low overhead: use only the tools that fit your current needs.

## Create Your Project Repository on GitHub

Start a new project from this template; do not fork it or work directly in the template repository. A repository created from a template is your own independent project, with its own commits and history.

1. On the GitHub page for this template, select **Use this template**, then **Create a new repository**.
2. Choose the account or organization that should own the project.
3. Give the repository a clear name, such as `soil-analysis`, add a short description, and choose the visibility appropriate for your project and data-sharing requirements.
4. Select **Create repository from template**.
5. Clone your new repository to your computer using GitHub Desktop or the repository's **Code** button. From a terminal, the pattern is:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-ACCOUNT/YOUR-REPOSITORY.git
   cd YOUR-REPOSITORY
   ```

If you do not see **Use this template**, ask the instructor or repository owner to enable the repository's template setting. GitHub's [guide to creating a repository from a template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) includes screenshots and current interface details.

## Start Here

Follow these steps in order. You do not need to read every file in this repository.

1. Choose a project/package name and follow the [rename `mypackage` guide](guides/template-customization.md#rename-mypackage-your-first-customization). For example, `soil_analysis` is a clearer name than the starter name `mypackage`.
2. Create the environment if you want to use the provided Conda and Make workflow:

   ```bash
   make init
   ```

   The `make` commands are optional convenience commands; you can run the underlying tools directly instead. On Windows, `make` is not included by default. Installing `m2-base` in Conda often supplies it:

   ```bash
   conda install m2-base
   ```

3. Try the starter test when you are ready:

   ```bash
   make test
   ```

4. Open [00_START_HERE.ipynb](00_START_HERE.ipynb) if you prefer a guided notebook walkthrough.

## Where to Go Next

Use this README as your home base. Open another document only when it matches your current task.

## Paper and Proposal Scaffold

When you are ready to prepare a project proposal or a final manuscript for a JOSS-style submission, start with the scaffold in [paper/proposal.md](paper/proposal.md), [paper/paper.md](paper/paper.md), and [paper/paper.bib](paper/paper.bib). These files provide a simple starting point for the proposal and manuscript workflow and can be expanded as the project matures.

| If you want to… | Go to… |
|---|---|
| Rename the starter package, understand a file, or decide whether to remove one | [Template Customization Guide](guides/template-customization.md) |
| Start a project proposal or JOSS-style manuscript | [Paper and Proposal Scaffold](#paper-and-proposal-scaffold) |
| Write your first function and test | [What to Edit First](#what-to-edit-first) below |
| Learn about or enable a tool | [Tool Overview](#tool-overview) below |
| Use AI responsibly with code or research materials | [Research Software AI Policy](guides/ai-policy.md) |
| Share work through GitHub or pull requests | [Sharing Changes](#sharing-changes-optional) below |
| Publish API documentation | [API Docs Quick Start](#api-docs-quick-start-pdoc) below |

The AI configuration files (`AGENTS.md`, `.cursorrules`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, and GitHub's Copilot instructions) work in the background for the tools that use them. Students do not need to read or edit them to start a project. If you use AI, read the policy linked above before sharing research materials with an external tool.

## What to Edit First

1. Follow the [rename `mypackage` guide](guides/template-customization.md#rename-mypackage-your-first-customization) to choose and configure your project package name.
2. Replace [mypackage/example.py](mypackage/example.py) with your own module(s).
3. Update tests in [mypackage/tests/test_pytest.py](mypackage/tests/test_pytest.py).
4. Update this README with project goals, install instructions, and examples.

The test file already includes starter templates with short comments for:

- import/smoke tests
- fixtures
- parameterized tests
- exception tests
- regression tests

To get started writing your own tests, try this quick checklist:

1. Pick one function and write 3-5 known input/output examples.
2. Add one edge case (like zero, empty input, or boundary value).
3. Add one invalid input test with `pytest.raises(...)`.
4. Run `make test` and iterate.

## API Docs Quick Start (pdoc)

If you add clear docstrings, pdoc can turn them into browsable HTML docs quickly.

Try:

```bash
make init
make docs
```

Docstring features already demonstrated in [mypackage/example.py](mypackage/example.py):

- `Args`, `Returns`, and `Raises` sections
- `Examples` that readers can copy/paste
- `Notes` and `See Also` sections

Publishing tutorial:

- [GitHub Pages tutorial](guides/github-pages.md)
- Automated workflow: [.github/workflows/pages.yml](.github/workflows/pages.yml)
- pdoc docs: https://pdoc.dev/docs/pdoc.html
- GitHub Pages docs: https://docs.github.com/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site

To enable automatic publication, set GitHub Pages source to GitHub Actions in repository settings.

## Typical Workflow

```bash
make test         # optional

# other tools you can run when useful:
make format
make lint
make type
make audit
make secrets
make check-full
```

## Sharing Changes (Optional)

If students are using branches and pull requests, keep this simple:

1. Create/update environment:

	```bash
	make init
	```

2. Run checks before sharing (if your team uses them):

	```bash
	make test
	```

3. If advanced tools are enabled in your course, run:

	```bash
	make check-full
	```

## Is CI Helpful?

Yes, when kept minimal. This template runs tests in CI (`make test`) so students get value without heavy setup burden.

Progressive unlock option:

- The CI workflow in [.github/workflows/ci.yml](.github/workflows/ci.yml) includes commented lines for `make lint`, `make type`, and `make doclint`.
- Keep them commented for beginner classes.
- Uncomment one line at a time as students are ready.

## Beginner Guidance

- Start with `make init`, then try whichever `make` commands are helpful.
- Add optional tools only after your team sees recurring problems they can solve.
- Prefer consistency over complexity. A small workflow used every week is better than a large workflow used rarely.

## Notes for Reproducibility

- Keep `environment.yml` updated as tooling needs evolve.
- Add random seeds for stochastic experiments.
- Record key parameters and software versions in outputs.
- Avoid hidden local state and relative paths outside repo root.
- Prefer relative paths in code and notebooks (avoid machine-specific absolute paths).
- Avoid hard-coded algorithm settings when possible; use function arguments and sensible defaults.

## Repository Habits (Consistency Add-On)

These are selected practices aligned with the course-level repository rules:

- Keep repositories text-first when possible: code, Markdown, and config files are preferred over frequently changing binary files.
- Use `.gitignore` intentionally and review what is staged before each commit.
- Avoid storing raw/input/intermediate/output datasets directly in the code repository; document how to fetch or mount data instead.
- Keep interfaces layered: library/API first, command-line tools second, and GUI work last.
- Favor modular design and avoid copy/paste duplication across code and docs.
- Keep README as the onboarding entry point: install, run, and validate in as few steps as possible.
- For notebooks, include a top Markdown title/description cell and clear outputs before commit when practical.
- If AI/LLM tools contribute meaningfully, note usage briefly in commit messages (for example: `LLM: drafted initial test cases, then simplified manually`).
