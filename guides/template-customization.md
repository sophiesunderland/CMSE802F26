# Template File Guide

Start with [README.md](../README.md). Use this guide only when you are customizing the template, wondering what a file does, or deciding whether to remove one.

Decision labels:
- Keep: recommended for most student projects.
- Modify: keep the file path but replace or customize the content for your project.
- Optional: safe to remove if you are not using that workflow.
- Keep if used: remove only if your team confirms the feature is not needed.

## Suggested Lean Profile (Minimal Starter)

If your class wants the smallest practical setup, keep these and remove the rest later as needed:
- README.md (modify immediately)
- environment.yml
- makefile (if your class uses `make`)
- pyproject.toml
- LICENSE (modify if needed)
- mypackage/ (rename and modify)
- mypackage/tests/ (modify)
- guides/ai-policy.md
- AGENTS.md
- .github/copilot-instructions.md (if using Copilot)
- .github/workflows/ci.yml (if using GitHub)

## Rename `mypackage` (Your First Customization)

In Python, a *package* is the folder that holds code you can import into a notebook, script, or test. The template calls this folder `mypackage` only as a placeholder. Choose a short, lowercase name that describes your project, such as `soil_analysis`.

Fast path (recommended):

```bash
python scripts/rename_package.py soil_analysis
```

This helper script renames the package folder and updates common references in configuration, docs, workflow files, and the starter notebook.

For example, if you rename `mypackage` to `soil_analysis`, make these matching changes:

1. Rename the folder `mypackage/` to `soil_analysis/`. The `__init__.py` file stays inside that renamed folder; it tells Python to treat the folder as importable code.
2. Change imports wherever they occur. For example, change:

   ```python
   from mypackage import power_self
   ```

   to:

   ```python
   from soil_analysis import power_self
   ```

   In this template, check the test file and `00_START_HERE.ipynb` if you keep the notebook.
3. In [pyproject.toml](../pyproject.toml), change `testpaths = ["mypackage/tests"]` to `testpaths = ["soil_analysis/tests"]`. This tells pytest where to look for your tests when it is run without a path.
4. If you use the optional [makefile](../makefile), change `MODULENAME ?= mypackage` to `MODULENAME ?= soil_analysis`. `MODULENAME` is just a variable: it tells commands such as `make test`, `make lint`, and `make docs` which code folder they should use.
5. If you keep GitHub Pages documentation, change `mypackage` in [.github/workflows/pages.yml](../.github/workflows/pages.yml) to `soil_analysis`. This tells pdoc which package to turn into documentation.
6. Search the repository for `mypackage` and replace any remaining student-facing examples, such as README text or notebook starter-file checks.

Why update all of these? If the folder and imports disagree, Python cannot find your code. If a configuration file still uses the old name, a tool may test, format, or document the wrong location.

To check the rename, run `make test` if your project uses Make. Otherwise, from the repository root, start Python and try `import soil_analysis`. A successful import confirms that Python can find the renamed package.

## Pass-By-Default Automation Notes

This template is set up so a fresh GitHub repository from template should pass CI without first-day debugging. Updating the matching references above keeps that true after customization.

## Add New Functions with Fewer Edits

To keep student workflow simple, this template uses a module-level export list.

Default pattern:

1. Add your new function in `mypackage/example.py` (or your renamed package module).
2. Add the function name to that module's `__all__` list.
3. Add or update tests.

Because `mypackage/__init__.py` derives package exports from the module `__all__`, students usually do not need to edit `__init__.py` each time they add a function in the same module.

When should students still edit `__init__.py`?

- When introducing a brand new module file (for example `mypackage/stats.py`) and they want top-level imports like `from mypackage import summarize`.
- When they intentionally want a narrower public API than the module `__all__`.
